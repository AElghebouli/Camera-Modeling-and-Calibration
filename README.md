# Camera-Modeling-and-Calibration
We are going to simulate using Python, the projection of a camera, by looking for its projection matrix. This matrix will be computed by a function that receives as inputs the extrinsic (rotation, translation) and intrinsic (K (3 Ã— 3)) parameters, then by the "Hall" method.
